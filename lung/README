In our case, the problem we will be exploring is M ulti-Class Classification
This is because we're going to be using a Histopathological Images about a person to
predict whether they have:

• Lung benign tissue
• Lung adenocarcinoma
• Lung squamous cell carcinoma

This dataset contains 15,000 histopathological images with 3 classes.
All images are 768 x 768 pixels in size and are in jpeg file format. The images were
generated from an original sample of HIPAA compliant and validated sources, consisting
of 750 total images of lung tissue (250 benign lung tissue, 250 lung adenocarcinomas,
and 250 lung squamous cell carcinomas) and augmented to 15,000 using the Augmentor
package. There are three classes in the dataset, each with 5,000 images
