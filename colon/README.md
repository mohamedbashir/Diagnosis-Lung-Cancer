Diagnosis Colon Cancer

In our case, the problem we will be exploring is Binary-Class Classification
This is because we're going to be using a Histopathological Images about a person to
predict whether they have:

• Colon benign tissue
• Colon adenocarcinoma

This dataset contains 10,000 histopathological images with 2 classes.
All images are 768 x 768 pixels in size and are in jpeg file format. 
The images weregenerated from an original sample of HIPAA compliant and validated sources, consisting
of 750 total images of colon tissue (250 Colon benign tissue, 250 Colon adenocarcinoma) and augmented to 10,000 using the Augmentor
package. There are two classes in the dataset, each with 5,000 images
